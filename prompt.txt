1. The Toolbareditor icons should always be visible, should not be overlayed by markdowneditor [icons should not hide]
2. IF they start overlaying, collapse teh sidebar
3. If you think there is a need to adjust the gaps between editor toolbar icons, as per the screen size do that
4. Adjust the MarkdownEditor and Sidebar panels accordingly as per screen
5. Minimum size of sidebar when collapsed is 5 %, when expanded 22 % [can change dynamically based on screen, for smaller screen sizes, can go upto 50 %]
